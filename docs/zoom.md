#### Setting up Zoom

In order to protect the privacy of our class meetings, students must use their GMU Zoom account to join the class meetings. In order to attend the class, you must sign in with your GMU email address. Note, that our zoom meetings will **require** the Zoom desktop client on Mac or PC, or on an iOS or Android device, you will **NOT** be able to join the class meetings using the Zoom web app in your browser. You can download the latest Zoom client from [this link](https://zoom.us/download).


This is an online course that will combine synchronous and asynchronous elements, meaning that we will meet together on Zoom at designated a time each week, and the rest of the weekâ€™s activities and discussions will be completed according to your own schedule via Piazza. All important due dates will be listed on the [Course Schedule](../schedule). All work will be submitted via Piazza (for discussions) or Blackboard (for the course project) unless otherwise noted by the instructor.

#### Virtual Lecture Format

Given that our course will be virtual this Fall, and that we are scheduled to meet for over 2.5 hours, lectures in this course will be dynamic in nature. I envision that for most classes lectures will generally only occupy about 1/2 of the class time. It is my belief that lectures longer than this become counterproductive in this virtual format. The remainder for each class will be utilized either for (1) interactive group activities (2) will allow time for collaboratively working on the course project, or (3) will be reserved for tech talks. We will utilize the Breakout Room feature of Zoom in order to conduct interactive sessions.

#### Virtual Class Etiquette

Given that our class meetings will be virtual, it also means we have to be more mindful and considerate so that we can create a fun but conducive learning environment for everyone. To foster this environment, I ask the following:

* *Microphones are muted during lecture.* If there is a question, please feel free to raise it in the chat window or raise your hand such that I can call on you at the next opportune time.
* *If you choose not to have your camera turned on, please have a photo of yourself on your Zoom profile.* It helps me to teach to your lovely faces, rather than black squares with names in them .
* *Group in-class assignments will be done in breakout rooms.* This is a time to have your microphones unmuted and to engage with your fellow classmates (and of course counts towards your participation grade).
* *Reactions, comments, and feedback are welcome (if not encouraged) as you feel moved by my lectures or questions raised by other students!* I want class to be fun and engaging. But please keep it cordial and respectful.

#### Course Recordings and Privacy

All of our synchronous meetings in this class will be recorded to provide necessary information for students in this class. Recordings will be posted on the course website (for lectures), or Blackboard (for Tech Talks).

All course materials posted to Blackboard, Piazza or other course sites are private; by federal law, any materials that identify specific students (via their name, voice, or image) must not be shared with anyone not enrolled in this class.

* Video recordings of class meetings that include audio or visual information from other students are private and must not be shared
* Live Video Conference Meetings (e.g. Collaborate or Zoom) that include audio or visual information from other students must be viewed privately and not shared with others in your household
