### Description

In the Final Project Presentation, your project group will give a brief **6 minute presentation** on the process you used in shaping the interaction design of your app.
 
*	Your presentation should contain 3 sections:

	1. Briefly summarize (in a minute or less) the purpose of your app and the key use cases it supports. Include a link to the final version of your app. This might or might not take the form of a brief demo. It should be clear from your summary the primary use cases that your app supports.
	2.	Briefly describe 2 of the most "interesting" (e.g., far-reaching, unexpected, surprising) revisions you made to your app over the course of the semester. For each revision, describe (1) the original design and behavior of the app (a screenshot may help), (2) the method used to identify the issue (e.g., heuristic evaluation, visual design guideline), (3) the issue, and (4) how the issue was addressed in the revised design. 
	3.	Reflecting on the project as a whole over the course of the semester, briefly describe 2 lessons your group learned about HCI through working on your project. Lessons learned can be anything related to user interface design, including, but not limited to, when or how to use various HCI methods, an important design consideration you discovered, or the pros and cons of a particular design tradeoff. Your goal here is to offer two interesting insights into user interface design from which others may learn.

*	Your presentation should be short and be approximately 6 minutes. To ensure sufficient time for all groups to present, presentations cannot exceed 7 minutes. To help you keep track of time, you'll be notified at the 5 min, 6 min, and 7 min marks. If your presentation exceeds 7 minutes, your group will lose points, and you may be stopped. You should think carefully about how to cover each of the 3 sections within 6 minutes and should consider practicing to check the timing of your presentation.
