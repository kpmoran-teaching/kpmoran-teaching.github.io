## Course Assignments

### Assignments Overview

There will be 5 major assignments and will distributed over the course of the semester such that you will have two weeks to complete each assignment. Each of these assignments will help you to implement and gain experience with the different concepts and reinforce the material taught during lectures. These assignments will range from implementing simple web apps with a minimal feature set to Frontend and Backend development, to evaluating the user experience of a web app.


### Collaboration Policy

Homeworks should be completed individually, without close collaboration with other students. You are free to discuss "high-level" ideas with other students in the class. However, you are **not allowed** to share code under any circumstance. If you have any doubts about this policy, ask Dr. Moran or David. We are here to help!
