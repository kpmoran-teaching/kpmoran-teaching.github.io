### Overview
 
In this homework, you will create a simple microservice that fetches a dataset from a third-party API and offers endpoints for manipulating a local copy of this dataset.
 
### Assignment Instructions
 
#### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repo and Configure Heroku

In this step, you will create a GitHub repo for your homework assignment entitled "swe-432-hw2" and configure your repo to deploy your code using Heroku.

We will go over this process in class, and I will post detailed instructions below after class.
 
#### Step 2: Describe 7 User Scenarios

In this step, you will identify 7 scenarios that your microservice will support. Each scenario should correspond to a separate endpoint your microservice offers. At least 3 endpoints should involve information that is computed from your initial dataset (e.g., may not entirely consist of information from a 3rd party API). 
Imagine your microservice is offering city statistics. It might expose the following endpoints

*  Retrieve a city
	* GET /city/:cityID   
* Add a new city 
	* POST /city   
* Retrieve data on a city's average characteristics
	* GET: /city/:cityID/averages
* Retrieve the list of top cities
	* GET: /topCities    
* Get the current weather on a city
	* GET: /city/:cityID/weather
* Get the list of mass transit providers and links to their websites
	* GET /city/:cityID/transitProvders 
* Add a new transit provider
	* POST /city/:cityID/transitProvders 

 
#### Step 3: Implement your 7 defined User Scenarios

In this step, you will implement the seven user scenarios you identified in Step 2. You should ensure that requests made by your code to the third-party API are correctly sequenced. For example, requests that require data from previous request(s) should only occur after the previous request(s) have succeeded. If a request fails, you should retry the request, if appropriate, based on the HTTP status code returned. To ensure that potentially long running computation does not block your microservice and cause it to become nonresponsive, you should decompose long running computations into separate events. To ensure that you load data from your data provider at a rate that does not exceed the provider's rate limit, you may decide to use a timer to fetch data at specified time intervals.
 
Requirements:

* Use fetch to retrieve a dataset from a remote web service.
	* Data should be cached so that the same data is only retrieved from the remote web service once during the lifetime of your microservice.
	* You should handle at least one potential error generated by the third-party API.
	* Ensure all fetch requests are correctly sequenced.
* Declare at least 2 classes to process and store data and include some of your application logic.
* Endpoints
	* At least 4 endpoints with route parameters (e.g. /:userId )
	* At least 5 GET endpoints
	* At least 2 POST endpoints.
	* All invalid requests to your service should return an appropriate error message and status code.
* Decompose at least one potentially long running computation into separate events. It is not required that the computation you choose to decompose execute for any minimum amount of time. But you should choose to decompose a computation whose length will vary with the data returned by your data provider (e.g., the number of records returned).
* Use await at least once when working with a promise.
* Use JEST to write at least 12 unit tests to ensure that your code works correctly

### Using Resources
 
You are welcome and encouraged to consult any publicly available resource you wish (e.g., [Mozilla Developer Network documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), tutorials, blog posts, StackOverflow). However, in this assignment, all of the code you submit should be your own.
 
### Submission instructions

Submit your HW assignment through [**Blackboard**](https://mymasonportal.gmu.edu). You will be submitting two urls: (i) The url to your github repo, and (ii) the url where your service is deployed. We will post the instructions for setting up GitHub and Heroku after our next class.
